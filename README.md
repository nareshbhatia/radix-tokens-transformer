# Radix Tokens Transformer

This repo allows you to transform tokens exported from Figma into code usable on supported platforms.

## Folder structure
1. `tokens-from-figma`: contains tokens exported from Figma.
2. `tokens`: contains transformed tokens in w3c format.
3. `build`: contains platform code generated by Style Dictionary using the w3c tokens

## Getting Started

Export tokens from Figma and place them in the `tokens-from-figma` folder.

```shell
pnpm i

# Converts `tokens-from-figma` to w3c format
# Output is stored in the `tokens` folder
node src/transform-figma-tokens-to-w3c.js

# Converts `tokens` to platform code using Style Dictionary
# Output is stored in the `build` folder
node src/transform-w3c-tokens-to-platforms.js
```
